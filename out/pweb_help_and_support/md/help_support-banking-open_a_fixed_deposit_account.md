## Open a Fixed Deposit Account

Apply for a DBS Fixed Deposit Account with us via digibank.

  


### Important information

  * DBS Fixed Deposit Account gives you the opportunity to maximise your savings in Singapore dollars and foreign currencies with fixed interest within the same account, while keeping your funds secured.
  * You must be at least 18 years old to open an account and can hold only 1 personal DBS Fixed Deposit Account. 
  * You must be an existing digibank user with a personal or joint-alternate DBS/POSB Savings or Current Account. Learn more about how to [Open an Account with DBS/POSB](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/support/bank-account-new-opening.html).
  * Foreign Currency Fixed Deposit interest rates for new placements and renewals will be based on prevailing [interest rates](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/rates-online/foreign-currency-fixed-deposits.page).
  * SGD Fixed Deposit [interest rates](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/rates-online/sgdfd.page?pid=sg-dbs-help-support) for new placements and renewals will be computed based on the **Total SGD Fixed Deposit Balances** , instead of each placement and/or renewal. 

#####  Examples

    * **My Fixed Deposit account has 2 placements which sum up to S$100,000 (S$30,000 + S$70,000). What is the applicable interest rate for each renewal?**  
The total Fixed Deposit account balance is S$100,000 (S$30,000 + S$70,000). Hence, interest rate corresponding to the $100,000 - $249,999 range will apply.  

    * **I have an existing placement of S$50,000 in my single name Fixed Deposit account and another S$50,000 in a joint Fixed Deposit account. What is the applicable interest rate for each renewal?**  
The placements are in different SGD Fixed Deposit accounts. Hence, interest rate corresponding to the $50,000 - $99,999 range will apply for each renewal.
