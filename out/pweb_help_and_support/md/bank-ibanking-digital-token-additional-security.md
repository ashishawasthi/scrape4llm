# Additional security for your Digital Token

Find out when you will be prompted to make an additional verification step.

__  


## When will additional verification step be prompted

  * For your security, an additional verification using **Email OTP** is only required when you perform your **first high-risk transaction** (eg. Adding a payee, updating your personal particulars) after setting up your Digital Token.
  * As an added security, if you are logged in to digibank with Face/Touch ID, an additional verification using your **digibank log in PIN** is required for all **subsequent high-risk transactions**.



## Non-receipt of Email OTP

  * Check your Junk Folder.
  * Check if you have set any rules in place; and if the email is in another folder.
  * Check if you have set any automated email forwarding.
  * [Update Your Email Address](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/support/general-profile-update-email-address.html#myinfo) and resubmit transaction.



## More information

  * It is recommended that you only have your own biometrics stored in your mobile device. Any face or fingerprint stored on your device can be used to access the digibank app.
