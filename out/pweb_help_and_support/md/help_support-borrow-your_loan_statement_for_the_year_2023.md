## Your Loan Statement for the Year 2023

We have upgraded our system to serve you better! Here is what you can expect for your renovation loan and mortgage loan statements for the year 2023.

We will be sending out two loan statements instead of a full-year statement. 

  * Loan information from 1 January 2023 to 22 September 2023 will be available in September 2023 loan statement.
  * Loan information from 23 September 2023 to 31 December 2023 will be available in January 2024 loan statement.



### Frequently Asked Questions

#####  Are there going to be any changes to my loan balance, monthly instalment or loan tenor in September 2023?

Please be assured that there will not be any changes to your loan balance, monthly instalment and loan tenor. Your ending loan balance in the September 2023 statement will be brought forward to the next statement in January 2024. 

#####  Can I still opt to receive my loan information for the year 2023 in a single loan statement? 

As we have upgraded our systems, we will not be able to provide your loan information for the year 2023 in a single loan statement. From 2024 onwards, you will be able to receive your loan statement in a single loan statement again. 

#####  If I need supporting documents for proof of mortgage loan interest expenses for tax purposes, where can I find the information? 

You may find your mortgage loan interest expenses in your consolidated statement which can be retrieved from digibank. Find out how you can do so [here](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/support/loans-homeloan-check-total-interest.html).
