## Resolve Unexpected Card Transactions

Whether it’s a purchase you didn’t make, or you were charged the wrong amount, find out how to seek a resolution. If you made a wrong fund transfer from your deposit account, learn more about how to [Recall the Transfer](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/support/bank-local-wrong-funds-transfer.html).

If the posted transactions made through your credit or debit cards were not authorised by you, or if you encountered issues with the goods and services you have purchased, you can submit a request for a reversal of the charges (i.e. chargeback) in most instances.   
  
If the transaction is still at pending status, we would need to monitor for the transaction status to change to posted (merchant had processed and claimed the funds) before we can proceed for the chargeback request.  
  
We can help you raise a chargeback request if you encountered credit or debit card transactions that you may not recognise. Before you do so, we suggest that you do the following checks:

  * **Merchant name**  
Some organisations may use a different name for payment processing. Hence you could be paying to the correct merchants for your goods and services.
  * **Transaction date**  
The transaction date on your card statements may not be on the same day of the transactions. This is not a cause of concern if the transactions were legitimate, as some merchants may take a few days to make a settlement for the transactions.
  * **Supplementary cardholder**  
Check if the transactions you did not expect could have been made by the supplementary cardholder instead.



### 3D Secure transactions

Cybercriminals may use computing technology to guess a valid combination of credit or debit card number, expiration date and card verification value (CVV), and test them by making real online transactions with certain merchants. Fraudulent transactions can also happen when cybercriminals use card details stolen from unsecured websites.  
  
3D Secure (3DS) is an online security feature powered by AMEX, Mastercard and Visa to further secure cardholder not present (i.e. online) card transactions over the internet.  
  
Customers are not liable for unauthorised transactions if a merchant has not required consumers to authorise online card transactions by 3DS.

#####  Why do card transactions on some online merchant websites require further verification (such as Digital Token or SMS OTP authentication) while others do not?

  * This is dependent on the merchant's website. If the merchant website you transact on supports 3D Secure technology, you will be prompted for further verification (such as Digital Token or SMS OTP authentication) before completing the online card transactions.
  * Merchant websites that support 3DS technology will incorporate the following logos:  
  

  * Merchants may opt out of 3DS. Others could have required 3DS authentication only for bigger transactions.



#####  What happens when I transact with a merchant website supporting 3DS?

  * When a cardholder makes a purchase at a merchant website that uses 3DS, the cardholder will be asked to authenticate that transaction, by tapping on a push notification sent via their DBS Digital Token or entering a SMS OTP, before the transaction can be completed.

#####  How does 3DS protect cardholders from unauthorised transactions?

  * Before completing your online purchase, you will be asked to authenticate that transaction, by tapping on a push notification sent via DBS Digital Token or a SMS OTP which will be sent to your registered mobile number with the bank.
  * This additional authorisation step protects customers against fraudulent use by unauthorised individuals.



#####  What types of unauthorised transactions are not eligible for chargeback request?

  * With many online merchants already implemented 3DS technology, the risk of unauthorised transactions is mitigated as the cardholder would have to verify his or her identity before the purchase can be processed. 
  * For unauthorised online transactions done with merchants with 3DS technology, the liability for the disputed transaction would be imposed on the cardholder, if the cardholder’s failure to practice good cyber hygiene has been a contributing factor.



#####  How can I customise my card setting to control what I want to use my card for since I do not shop online? How can I protect my cards from unauthorised transactions?

  * You can customise your card function using Payment Controls on digibank. It allows you to enable the functions you need and disable what you don't. Learn more on how to [Customise your Card Functions](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/support/card-customise-card-functions.html).



#####  I noticed unfamiliar transactions from SMS alerts or from my card statements. What should I do?

  * Log in to digibank mobile to check the transaction.
  * If the transaction is not made by you, go to Payment Controls on the digibank mobile app, and lock the card. Follow our step-by-step guide to [Lock your Card Temporarily](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/support/card-temp-lock-card.html).
  * Please call DBS Fraud Reporting hotline 1800 339 6963 or (65) 6339 6963 from overseas.
  * DBS will investigate, and we will credit the disputed amount within 7 working days for successful cases. Should further verification be required, we will reach out to you within 7 working days.

You might encounter disputes with merchants on goods and services you have purchased. We can help you to seek recourse if the merchants fail to deliver or deliver defective merchandise, or if dissatisfactory products or services are rendered.

  * We would need from you documentary evidence of the purchase and correspondence with the merchant where goods or services were not received after the merchant had been notified of non-delivery.



#####  Can I dispute a transaction if I am not satisfied with the quality of the product or service provided by the merchant?

  * This depends on the sales agreement between the cardholder and the merchant. We advise you to first contact the merchant the merchant to resolve the dispute to either get an exchange or refund.
  * If the merchant refuses, you can [Get in Touch with Us](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/bank-with-ease/contact-us?pid=sg-dbs-help-support-general-incorrect-transaction.html#slideToN1018D) to raise a chargeback request with the merchant.

#####  I saw familiar transactions on my card statements but the merchant’s name or the amount charged differs. What should I do?
