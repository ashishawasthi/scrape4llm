More information about pre-market sessions is available on the HKEX and SGX web sites.

#####  What is Trade At Close (TAC) Period (applicable to SGX market only)?

The 10-minute-long TAC session will immediately follow the closing auction routine and allows participants to execute orders at the Closing Auction Price (CAP) set during the closing auction routine. The TAC session will occur at 5.06pm to 5.16pm on a regular trading day and from 12.06pm to 12.16pm if the market is trading for half a day.

During the TAC session, trades can only occur at a fixed price, that is CAP established by SGX during the “Non-Cancel Last” session. The CAP will be displayed on our platform.

If there is no closing auction price established during Non-Cancel Last session for the counter, then all the order entries will be rejected and there will be no order matching during TAC session on that business day for that counter.

All unfilled long dated orders (GTD/GTM) during TAC, will be carried over to the following trading day.

Limit orders can only be entered at the closing auction price. Order amendments and cancellation is allowed during TAC.

For more information on TAC, please refer to SGX [FAQ](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/common-disclaimer.page?url=https://www2.sgx.com/securities/trading&3rdparty=%27SGX%27) and [News Release.](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/common-disclaimer.page?url=https://www2.sgx.com/media-centre/20190514-sgx-launch-securities-market-trade-close-session-3-june&3rdparty=%27SGX%27)

  


**Examples**  
Closing Auction Price (provided by SGX) = $1.30  
Limit Order Price = $1.30  
Expected result: Order accepted by SGX  
  
Closing Auction Price (provided by SGX) = $1.30

\+ Singapore Market: The Market Order type can only be entered during trading hours, from 08:30 – 17:04

#####  What is the difference between market order and limit order? 

**Market Order**

When the market is opened, a market order will be executed at the best bid or ask price available. If a market order is placed when the market is closed, it will be executed at the bid or ask price when the market opens. A market order, unless it is a Fill or Kill (FOK), guarantees an execution but does not guarantee a price. A market order could be executed at a higher or lower price than what was quoted to you. Please note that market orders are not allowed for Hong Kong, Australia, Japan and UK markets trading.

Singapore Market: The Market Order type can only be entered during trading hours, from 08:30 – 17:04

**Limit Order**

When you place a limit order, you are stating the price at which you wish to buy or sell a stock. If that price is not met, your order will not be executed. A limit order guarantees a price but does not guarantee an execution. A limit order can be executed at a better price than the limit price you set.

#####  In Hong Kong market, what are the order types available?

**Limit Order:**  
A Limit order allows an order to be matched only at a specified price. A sell limit order cannot be below the current bid price, whereas a buy limit order cannot be above the current ask price. Any unmatched quantity will be placed in the price queue.  
  
**At-auction (Market) Order:**  
An at-auction order is a market order without a specified price. It enjoys a higher auction matching priority than an at-auction limit order. It will be cancelled automatically after order matching.  
  
**At-auction Limit Order:**  
An at-auction limit order is a limit order with a specified price. After order matching: Unfilled at-auction limit orders in the pre-opening session with input price not deviating nine times or more from the prevailing nominal price will be converted to limit orders at the input price and carried forward to the continuous trading session.  
  
**Enhanced Limit Order (ELO):**  
An ELO is similar to a Limit order. The difference between the two is that an ELO allows an order to be matched up to 10 price queues at one time. A buy order input price can be made at a price of 9 spreads above the current ask price, and a sell order input price can be made at a price of 9 spreads below the current bid price. Any unfilled quantity of an ELO after matching will be converted into a Limit Order and placed in the price queue at the order input price.  
  
**Special Limit Order (SLO)**  
An SLO allows an order to be matched up to 10 price queues, 9 spreads away, at one time as long as the traded price is better than the input price. There are no price restrictions on an SLO. However, the buy order input price must be at or above the best ask price, whereas the sell order input price must be at or below the best bid price. Any unfilled quantity of an SLO after matching will be cancelled. More information about ELO and SLO is available on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) website.

#####  What is an 'All Or None' (AON) order?

'AON' is a type of restricted order where the entire order must be filled at one time or nothing will be filled at all. If you do not specify your order as 'All Or None' when placing a limit order, there is a possibility that your order will be filled partially. Full commission fees and charges apply for each partial fill, except those transacted within the same business day.  
  
Please note that AON feature will only be available for limit orders in the US market and if the quantity is over 100 units.

#####  What is a Good for Day order?

A Good for Day order is a limit order good for that business day only. If the order is not filled by the end of the trading day, the order will expire. A Good for Day order placed after the market is closed is good for the next business day, unless it is placed specifically for after-hours trading.

#####  What is a Good till Date order?

A Good till Date order is a limit order good for the next 30 calendar days after the order is placed. The order will be cancelled on the morning following the 30th day. When you cancel and replace a good for 30 days order, the order will be given a new 30 calendar days expiration period. Good till Date order is only applicable for the Singapore, U.S., Canada, UK, Australia and Japan markets.

#####  What is a Good till Max order?

A Good till Max order is a limit order similar to Good till Date order. Order will automatically be good for the next 30 calendar days after the order is placed, and cancelled on the morning following the 30th day, unless order is fully filled, specifically cancelled, instrument de-listed, or purged for corporate actions. Good till Max orders are available in the Singapore market only.

#####  What is Fill or Kill order?

A market Fill or Kill (FOK) order is only applicable to the Singapore market. The entire quantity placed must be matched in full or the order will be cancelled. A market FOK order can only be entered during continuous trading hours from 09:00 – 12:00 and 13:00 – 17:00.

#####  What is Fill and Kill order?

A market Fill and Kill (FAK) order is only applicable to the Singapore market. Any portion of a market FAK order will be matched as soon as the order is placed and the remaining order will be cancelled. A market FAK order can only be entered during trading hours from 08:30 – 17:04

  


**Risks associated with using market orders**  
Please take note that by placing a market FAK order during SGX Opening Routine, Mid-Day Break or Closing Routine, the order will be participating in Matching during Non-Cancel Phase. Orders that can be matched are matched at a single price computed based on SGX Algorithm.  
  
A buy order can be filled at a much higher price than intended, or a sell order can be filled at a much lower price than intended.  
Using market orders during a volatile market is not recommended as there is a higher probability that the prices will change quickly.  
Hence, the incidence of ‘slippage’ is higher in fast-moving markets or for illiquid securities with thin order book and wide bid-ask spread.  
The order may be split across multiple investors on the other side of the transaction, resulting in different prices for the order.

**Description** | Round Lot (also known as Board Lot) is a standardized unit for trading. The lot size, or number of shares per Board Lot, is determined by the exchange.  | Any order quantity below the Board Lot size.

Board lot size = 100 shares.  
  
**Board Lot Order** = Order Qty of 300 shares  
| Odd Lot order refers to order quantity of 99 shares or below.  
i.e.  
Stock: DBS Bank (D05)  
Board lot size = 100 shares.  
  
**Odd Lot Order** = Order Qty of 59 shares  | Mixed Lot order refers to order quantity with a blend of Board Lot and Odd Lot.  
i.e.  
Stock: DBS Bank (D05)  
Board lot size = 100 shares.  
  
**Mixed Lot Order** = Order Qty of 359 shares   
  
Order quantity must be in multiples of the lot size as indicated on the platform.

### Risk Warning Statement

#####  What is the Risk Warning Statement (RWS) about?

Foreign-listed investment products, including EIPs, may carry a different set of risks and different levels of protection for investors from those offered locally. Intermediaries such as banks are required to warn retail customers (i.e. Non-Accredited Investors) of the possible risks prior to the customer's first purchase of a foreign-listed investment product from 28 February 2013 and to obtain the customer's acknowledgement on the risk warning disclosure. This will apply to all foreign-listed investment products, regardless of whether the customer has transacted in such products prior to 28 February 2013, and whether the customer is assessed to have the relevant knowledge or experience to transact in listed SIPs.

If the retail customer has not acknowledged the RWS on or by 28 February 2013, he/she will not be allowed to transact in any Overseas-Listed Investment Product, notwithstanding that he/she has qualified for the CAR. For joint account, each of the account holders has to acknowledge the RWS before the joint account can be used for transacting in any Overseas-Listed Investment Product.

Retail customers can acknowledge the prescribed Risk Warning Statement (RWS) by accepting it electronically after login to Online Equity Trading Account or signing and returning the RWS to the bank in hardcopy. Please read and understand the contents of the RWS before indicating your acknowledgement of the RWS. If you have any questions on the RWS, please contact your Relationship Manager or visit any of our branches.

#####  Can I still sell my existing holdings of Overseas Listed Investment Products if I do not acknowledge the Risk Warning Statement?

You can still liquidate/close out your existing holdings of Overseas Listed Investment Products if you do not acknowledge the Risk Warning Statement. However, you would need to acknowledge the Risk Warning Statement should you wish to purchase any Overseas Listed Investment Product(s).

#####  If I have multiple trading accounts with DBS Bank, do I need to acknowledge the Risk Warning Statement for every trading account?

The Primary Account Holder only needs to acknowledge the Risk Warning Statement once and the acknowledgement will be applied to all the Individual trading accounts that he/she has maintained with DBS Bank. However, the Joint Account Holder (if any) and Mandate(s) (if any) are required to sign all Risk Warning Statement Form(s) for the trading account(s) that they are authorised to operate.

### Customer Account Review (Listed Specified Investment Products)

#####  What is the Customer Account Review about?

Effective from 1 January 2012, financial institutions such as banks, broking firms and financial advisors are required to assess if a retail investor (i.e. Non-Accredited Investor) has the relevant knowledge or experience to understand the risks and features of derivatives before offering any Specified Investment Products (SIPs) to him/her. Therefore, the Bank requires you to complete a Customer Account Review (CAR) to ascertain your understanding of derivatives before you invest in any SIPs listed on an exchange, regardless you are new or existing customer. You must be assessed to possess knowledge or experience in derivatives in pursuant of CAR before the Bank allows you to request trading listed SIPs via your DBS Online Equity Trading accounts.

#####  What are Listed Specified Investment Products? 

SIPs are derivatives, or products which may contain derivatives. They have complex features and risks which can expose you to more factors which can cause a loss. For example, a SIP may involve many parties, and your investment can be affected if any one or more of them fail. It may also be difficult to understand how the derivative can fully impact the performance of the product at the outset. The returns or losses on a product may be determined by complicated formulas that may not be easy to understand. Some SIPs are listed on an exchange, for example:

  1. Certificates
  2. Exchanged Traded Funds (ETFs)
  3. Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs)
  4. Futures (Extended Settlement Contracts)
  5. Structured Warrants
  6. Callable Bull / Bear Contracts (CBBCs)



The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has also prescribed a list of capital markets products as Excluded Investment Products (EIPs). EIPs are generally less complex products which are already established in the market and are generally well understood by retail investors.

With effect from 4 January 2013, certain overseas-listed investment products are re-classified from SIPs to EIPs as set out below.

List of Stock Exchanges with overseas listed SIPs reclassified as EIPs:

  1. Australia
  2. Canada
  3. Hong Kong

  7. Taiwan
  8. Thailand
  9. United Kingdom
  10. United States (namely NYSE, Nasdaq and AMEX)
  11. China B
  12. Indonesia
  13. Philippines



List of overseas-listed investment products that are re-classified from SIPs to EIPs in the above Stock Exchanges:

  1. Ordinary Shares
  2. Preference Shares
  3. Deferred Shares
  4. Company Warrants
  5. Fully Paid Depository Receipts representing shares (eg ADR)
  6. Subscription Rights
  7. Real Estate Trust
  8. Bonds (Plain Vanilla)



Please note that the Bank may not offer securities trading for all the above 13 Stock Exchanges and the EIP classification may change from time to time.

#####  How will the requirements affect retail investors (i.e. Non-Accredited Investors) like me?

If you wish to trade listed SIPs, the Bank will have to conduct a CAR based on your declaration of your educational qualifications, work experience and investment or trading experience to assess whether you have the knowledge or experience to understand the features and risks of SIPs before you can apply for a DBS Online Equity Trading account to trade in listed SIPs.
