After you replace your existing Debit or Credit Card, details such as Expiry Date, CVV/CVC Number and/or Card Number will be changed for security purposes. This may affect your existing recurring bill payments with Billing Organisations.  
  
To prevent any lapse in payments, please update the respective Billing Organisations of your new card details upon receiving your new card.
