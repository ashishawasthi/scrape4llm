### Important information

  * Inform all billing organisations and make alternative arrangement for your recurring bill payments. You may refer to your past statements to check if you have any recurring payment arrangement. 
  * Redeem all your DBS points, Daily$ _(For POSB Everyday Card)_ , Safra$ _(For Safra DBS Credit/ Debit Card)_ , TapForMore points _(For PAssion Debit Card)_ before the card is terminated. Your DBS rewards will not be transferred to other active card(s) and will be forfeited upon card termination.
  * For security reasons, please cut each card in half and dispose of them straight away. If there are outstanding balances remaining, your monthly statement will continue to be sent to you until full payment has been made.
  * Please note that all active instalment plans _(e.g. Personal Loan, My Preferred Payment Plan, Instalment Payment Plan)_ will be terminated along with the card termination. An early termination fee will be levied for each instalment plan(s) being terminated _(please refer to the respective product Terms & Conditions for more information)_.
  * If you have any credit balance on your card account, please request for a refund through us. Do not perform the transfer on your own as it will be regarded as Cash Advance which will be subjected to Cash Advance fee and charges.
