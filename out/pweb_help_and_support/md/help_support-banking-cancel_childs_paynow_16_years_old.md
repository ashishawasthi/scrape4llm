### Frequently Asked Questions

#####  What happens when my child becomes older than 16 years old? Do I need to cancel their payNow?

No, your child may now apply for digibank and continue to use PayNow service.   
However, if you need to cancel your Child’s PayNow Service, you may do so with the following steps. 

#####  Can my child register for PayNow again after cancellation?

Yes, certainly! After cancellation, your child is able to apply for PayNow again. 

#####  I recently became a Singapore Permanent Resident (PR), and would like to register my NRIC as a PayNow Proxy. What will happen to my FIN Proxy?

Once you receive your blue NRIC, please proceed to the nearest DBS/POSB branch to update your NRIC in the bank's records. During the update process, your FIN Proxy will be de-registered from PayNow and your NRIC will become eligible for registration.  
  
You can subsequently register your NRIC as a PayNow Proxy, via DBS iBanking, iWealth or your digibank App.
