# Understanding DBS Multiplier's Preferential Interest

Find out how the interest is calculated and credited for DBS Multiplier Account.

## Important information

  * Preferential interest is credited by the 7th working day of the following month, if criteria is met.
  * If your transactions do not meet the criteria, the SGD balance in your DBS Multiplier Account will be accorded the prevailing interest rate for that month. [Learn More](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/rates-online/multiplier-account.page).



## How is the interest calculated?

  * The preferential interest rate is applied to the end-day SGD balance in your DBS Multiplier Account.
  * Interest earned for each balance tier is calculated and rounded off to the nearest 4 decimal places. 
  * Each day’s interest earned is summed up and rounded off to the nearest 2 decimal places.
  * The entire month's interest is then summed up.



## How is the interest credited?

Multiplier interest is credited in **2 parts** :  Interest Type | Interest Rate | Credit Date | Example: 1.50% p.a.  
---|---|---|---  
Base interest | 0.05% p.a. | Last calendar day of the month | 0.05% p.a.  
Preferential interest (if any) | Higher interest rate - Base interest rate | 7th working day of the following month | 1.50% - 0.05% = 1.45% p.a.
