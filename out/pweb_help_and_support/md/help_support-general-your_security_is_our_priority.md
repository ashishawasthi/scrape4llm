## Your Security Is Our Priority

In the light of today’s ever-evolving scam landscape, DBS/POSB has been bolstering our multi-layered defence against scams and fraud, so you can bank safely with peace of mind.   
  
Here’s a suite of security measures we’ve implemented to help protect you:

#####  Block access to funds in case of suspected scam with Safety Switch

If you think you've provided personal details to scammers by mistake, Safety Switch lets you to block access to your funds immediately. This can be activated 24/7 via the DBS Hotline at 1800 339 6963. 

#####  Lock away funds in a digital safety deposit box with digiVault

You can transfer funds from your accounts into your personal digiVault. These funds cannot be transferred out digitally, but can only be accessed after verifying your identity, such as in person at a DBS/POSB branch. This helps protect the funds from scammers performing fraudulent digital transfers. 

#####  Enhanced capabilities to detect and block malware

To counter rising malware scams, DBS/POSB has enhanced its anti-malware tool that restricts access to digibank mobile when it detects malicious activity. Your access to digibank will be blocked if it detects a) the presence of malware or malicious applications, b) apps downloaded from unverified app stores (sideloaded apps) with accessibility permission enabled that can attempt unauthorised access to the DBS/POSB digibank app on a customer’s device or c) ongoing screen-sharing / mirroring on the device.  
  
Your access will be restored once these risks are removed. A good practice is to only download apps from official app stores.  
  


  
Rest assured that your personal privacy will always be protected. Our security measures will not monitor your phone activity, nor collect or store your personal data.
