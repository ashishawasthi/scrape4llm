  * Difference between Asset Class View and Asset Type View



# Difference between Asset Class View and Asset Type View

Holdings can be viewed by Asset Class or Asset Type - understand the difference here.

  
  


On your portfolio holdings page, you can view your holdings by Asset Class View or Asset Type View.

### Asset Class View

Asset Class View is an overview of your investments based on our Chief Investment Officer’s (CIO) Asset Allocation Model. Each asset class reflects different risk and return investment characteristics. The classification forms the link between assets and model portfolios, thus allowing products in your portfolio to be mapped against CIO asset classes.   
  


### Asset Type View

Asset Type View is a complete view of all your investment products.
