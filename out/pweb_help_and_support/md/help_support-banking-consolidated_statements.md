# Help & Support -> Banking -> Consolidated Statements

## Consolidated Statements

This is a monthly statement that consolidates details of your deposit accounts, investments and loan products based on the mailing address linked to these accounts.   


  
**Prefer to view your personal and joint Fixed Deposit account transactions in one consolidated statement? We are working on creating that seamless one-glance option for you and will keep you updated.**

### Important information

  * Do note that Credit Card transactions will be reflected in a separate statement.
  * For Passbook accounts included in the consolidated statements, you will only be able to view the overall balance in the account summary. Should you wish to view your transactional details, please update your passbook.
  * If you only have passbook accounts with the bank, there will be no consolidated statement generated
