### Frequently Asked Questions

#####  I submitted a transfer request, but the funds were not credited to my recipient. Why is this so?

Please note you will receive two notifications if your funds are successfully transferred to your recipient. The first notification indicates a successful submission of your request. An additional notification will be sent to you when the transfer has been successfully, or unsuccessfully made to the recipient. You can also refer to your bank account balance to check if the funds have been successfully debited.
