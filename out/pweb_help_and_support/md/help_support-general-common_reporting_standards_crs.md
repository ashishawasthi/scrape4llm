## Common Reporting Standards (CRS)

Common Reporting Standards is an international agreement to exchange financial account information in tax matters to identify account holders who are tax residents of other participating jurisdictions.

  


### Overview

The **Common Reporting Standards (CRS)** is an internationally agreed standard for automatic exchange of financial account information in tax matters, endorsed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The objectives of CRS are to deter and detect tax evasion by taxpayers through the use of offshore financial accounts.  
  
Under the CRS, financial institutions of participating jurisdictions are required to identify their account holders who are tax residents of other reportable jurisdictions. Relevant account information of these account holders would be reported to the local tax authorities, who would, in turn, exchange the information with the tax authorities of the participating jurisdictions where the account holders are tax residents.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#####  Why am I requested to submit a CRS self-certification about my tax residency status?

Under CRS, Singapore-based financial institutions are required to conduct due diligence to identify the tax residence of their account holders. In this regard, we may contact our customers to request for information about tax residency status. If you are a tax resident in a country with which Singapore has signed an agreement to exchange financial account information, we have to disclose your account information to Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS). 

#####  How would the Bank treat my case if I do not meet the Bank’s request to submit the CRS Self-Certification?

The bank will determine your tax residency based on the information held in our records. If we determined that you are a tax resident in a country with which Singapore has signed an agreement to exchange financial account information, we have to disclose your account information to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS).

#####  How do I determine my tax residency?

If you have questions on how to determine your jurisdiction of tax residence, you can: 

  * Refer to the [Rules Governing Tax Residence](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/common-disclaimer.page?url=https://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/crs-implementation-and-assistance/tax-residency/&3rdparty=%27OECD%27&pid=sg-dbs-pweb-deposits-bank-with-ease-crs-txtlink-oecd) published by the different jurisdictions for information on the respective jurisdiction's tax residency rules;
  * Check with the tax authority of the jurisdiction which you think you may be a tax resident. (e.g. If you have stayed in Country A for more than 6 months, you can seek a confirmation from the tax authority of Country A on whether you are regarded as its tax resident for the tax year); or
