### Frequently Asked Questions

#####  What shall I do if I know the recipient but I accidentally made a funds transfer to the person?

If you know the person well, you may wish to liaise with the person to transfer the funds back to you. 

#####  What if the recipient doesn’t want to return my funds?

You may consider lodging a police report if you are certain that it is an erroneous funds transfer and have received confirmation that the recipient did not consent to returning the funds.   
  
It is an offence under the Penal Code for the recipient to retain or use the funds after being informed that it was sent by mistake. A Singapore Police Force investigating officer will typically be assigned to your case and provide subsequent updates directly to you. 

#####  How will I know the status of my recall request?

We will send you updates via e-mail. Please ensure that you e-mail address is updated in our Bank’s record. 

#####  Can the Bank expedite the recall request? I need the money back urgently.

With regrets, we are not able to expedite the recall process as it involves providing the recipient due notice of the erroneous funds transfer and, in some cases, their consent to remove the funds from their accounts.
