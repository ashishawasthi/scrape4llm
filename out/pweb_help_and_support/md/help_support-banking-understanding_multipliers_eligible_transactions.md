### Frequently Asked Questions

#####  Income

**Q1) What should I do if my salary credit is not recognised?**  
You can inform your company HR to use GIRO code 22 when they process the payroll/salary file to their corporate bank.   
  
**Q2) If I have a joint account, how will our income transactions be recognised?**  
The combined total salary and dividend credits in that joint account will be recognised under the individual Multiplier Accounts.   
  
**Example 1:**  
John and Mary credit their salaries (S$3,000 and S$3,100 respectively) and dividends (S$500 each) into their joint POSB savings account. They have their own Multiplier Accounts and are accorded a total income amount of S$7,100 each.   
  
**Example 2:**  
George credits his salary of S$4,000 into a joint POSB savings account shared with Emily. Emily does not have an income. They have their own Multiplier Accounts and are accorded a total income amount of S$4,000 each. 

#####  Credit Card Spend

**Q1) What are the eligible credit card transactions?**  
Only posted retail and cash advance transactions will be recognised as eligible credit card spend. Balance transfers, instalment payment plans, preferred payment plans, and any fees / charges imposed by the bank are not eligible.   
  
**Example:**  
Transaction date: 30 Aug | Credit card spend is made at a merchant.   
---|---  
Posting date: 1 Sep | Transaction is posted to your credit card account.   
This transaction is therefore recognised under September’s credit card spend (not August).  
  
**Q2) Do I have to link my Multiplier Account to my DBS/POSB Credit Card in order for my credit card transactions to be recognised?**  
No. Eligible credit card transactions are automatically detected across all the personal DBS/POSB Credit Cards held by you. Multiplier Account recognises credit card transactions made via American Express® /MasterCard® /Visa. 

#####  Insurance

**Q1) I wish to change my premium payment frequency e.g. yearly to monthly or vice versa. Will my policy still be recognised for this month?**  
In the event that there are changes to the insurance policy, the monthly premium will cease to be included as an eligible transaction. This will take effect from the month where the changes are made. Changes can include but are not limited to change in premium payment frequency and reassignment of policy ownership.  
  
**Q2) I was late in paying my premium due this month. Will my policy still be recognised as eligible transaction for this month?**  
Yes. Your policy will still be recognised as long as your policy is still in force.  
  
**Q3) If my policy premium due is paid quarterly/annually, how is the transaction recognised?**  
We will derive the monthly premium amount from dividing the annualised premiums by 12.  
  
**Q4) How to check the number of eligible months that I have paid for my insurance policy?**  
You may view the breakdown of eligible months for your insurance transaction via Bank & Earn Summary in digibank Mobile.  
  


#####  Investment

**Q1) If my investments are in foreign currency, how will they be recognised?**  
Investment transactions will be recognised as the Singapore dollar equivalent at DBS’ prevailing exchange rate.   
  
**Q2) If the investment amount is deducted from a joint DBS/POSB deposit account, will the transaction be recognised for both account holders?**  
The transaction will be accorded to the investment applicant only.  
  
**Q3) How to check the number of eligible months that I have paid for my investment policy?**  
You may view the breakdown of eligible months for your investment transaction via Bank & Earn Summary in digibank Mobile.  
  
**DBS Invest-Saver**  
  
**Q1) Can I terminate my existing DBS Invest-Saver and re-purchase to be recognised?**  
No. For the re-purchase to be recognised, the fund has to be terminated and fully redeemed for at least 6 months from the date of termination or date of full redemption, whichever is later. Alternatively, you may consider purchasing a new fund to continue recognition.  
  
**Example:**  
Termination Date | 29 April  
---|---  
Full Redemption Date | 30 April  
Re-purchase Set Up Date Re-purchase after 30 October will be recognised  
  
**Q2) I have just signed up for DBS Invest-Saver. How will it be recognised?**  
DBS Invest-Saver will be recognised in the same month if you sign up before the deduction date, 15th of the month (or the next business day if the 15th is a Sunday or Public Holiday). Else, it will be recognised the next month. It will be recognised for the first 12 consecutive months after the free-look/cancellation period or 4 calendar days after the settlement date.   
  
**Example:**  
Deduction Date | 15 April (or next business day if 15th is a Sunday or Public Holiday)   
---|---  
Settlement Date | 21 April (3 to 4 working days, depending on fund house)   
Recognition Date | 25 April (4 calendar days after the settlement date)  
  
**Q3) If I change the amount of my existing DBS Invest-Saver within the 12-month period, will it be recognised?**  
Yes, you may update the amount and it will be recognised if deduction is successful  
  
**Q4) My DBS Invest-Saver contribution is not recognised for the month. Why is that so?**  
Recognition of the monthly contributions as eligible transactions will cease from the month where there is any failed deduction, or the DBS Invest-Saver is terminated.  
  
**Online Equity Trade**  
  
**Q1) What transactions are ineligible for higher interest?**  
The following transactions are ineligible: Contra trades, sell trades, and trades executed via Trading Representatives and DBS Vickers Customer Service Line.   
  
**Q2) If I have an joint DBS Wealth Management Account, will the transaction be recognised for both account holders?**  
For joint DBS Wealth Management Account, the equity trades will be recognised in full for each joint account holder under their individual DBS Multiplier Accounts.
