### Overview

**Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)** is a regulatory requirement for tax authorities to obtain financial account information of US Persons. FATCA came into effect in Singapore from 9 December 2014.  
  
Under FATCA, financial institutions in Singapore are to carry out reviewing procedures and disclose financial account information of account holders who are US Persons to the **Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS)**.  
  
If you have questions on how to determine your jurisdiction of tax residence, you can: 

  * Refer to the [Rules Governing Tax Residence](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/common-disclaimer.page?url=https://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/crs-implementation-and-assistance/tax-residency/&3rdparty=%27OECD%27&pid=sg-dbs-pweb-deposits-bank-with-ease-crs-txtlink-oecd) published by the different jurisdictions for information on the respective jurisdiction's tax residency rules; 
  * Check with the tax authority of the jurisdiction which you think you may be a tax resident. (e.g. If you have stayed in Country A for more than 6 months, you can seek a confirmation from the tax authority of Country A on whether you are regarded as its tax resident for the tax year); or 
  * Consult a tax advisor.
