#####  Protecting your Card 

You can protect yourself from credit card fraud by learning how to take precautionary measures, making it harder for someone to steal your card or card information.

  


###### Do's:

  * Sign your cards with permanent ink as soon as they arrive.
  * Keep a record of your card numbers, their expiration dates, and the phone number and address of our bank in a secure place.
  * Keep an eye on your card during the transaction and get it back as quickly as possible.
  * Inform us immediately when you change your address. If possible, inform us in advance.
  * Keep your cards in the same place after use. This way, you will notice immediately if they are lost or stolen.
  * Update any change in your contact numbers, be it your Mobile, Home or Office number, so we can contact you if we detect any suspicious or irregular card activities on your account.
  * Respond quickly to your banks call or SMS on transaction verification. However, learn to make sure that the call or SMS is really from DBS Bank.

  


###### Don'ts:

  * Sign a blank charge slip.
  * Lend your credit or charge card to anyone.
  * Leave cards or receipts lying around.
  * Write your card information on a postcard or the outside of an envelope.
  * Keep card information such as your PIN number, in the same place as your card.
  * Give out your card number or other personal information over the phone or to anyone, unless you are sure it is from a company you know and trust. No one should ask for your password or PIN.



#####  Protecting your PIN

  * Change your PIN regularly. Set reminders to change the Personal Identification Number (PIN) and password of your digibank account and other banking apps like PayLah! regularly. This reduces the risk of your password and account being compromised.
  * If youâ€™re setting up a new PIN or password, avoid words, phrases or sequences that are easily guessed. That rules out using your birthdate or phone number as a PIN. Depending on your mobile device, technologies such as TouchID and facial recognition can help authenticate you securely.
  * Avoid using the same PIN or password for all your banking and non-banking related accounts.
