# Returned/Bounced Cheque

Find out what are the cheque returned reasons and the fees that will be incurred.

## Common cheque returned reasons:

  * **Refer to drawer:** Clarifications have to be sought from the person who issued the cheque.
  * **Effects not cleared:** There were incoming funds to the cheque issuer’s account but they did not clear in time to fund this cheque.
  * **Exceeds Arrangement:** The cheque amount may have exceeded the transfer limit on the issuer’s account. Please clarify with the cheque issuer.
  * **Awaiting Banker’s Confirmation:** It is pending issuer’s bank confirmation to release the payment.

  * You will be receiving an Image Return Document (IRD) of the cheque within **3-5 working days** , once the cheque is bounced.
  * There will be no cheque return fee incurred for the cheque depositor.
  * The cheque return reason will be stated in the IRD.
  * Do liaise with the cheque issuer to confirm if the IRD can be re-deposited. 
    * This means that you _may re-deposit_ the IRD at any DBS/POSB cheque deposit box (like a normal cheque) to get your funds.  

    * This means that the IRD _cannot be re-deposited_. To get your funds, please make alternative arrangements with the cheque issuer (e.g. fund transfer or write a new cheque).  




  * For cheques that are returned due to the following reasons, you may incur a charge of S$40 per returned cheque. 
    * Refer to drawer due to Insufficient Funds
    * Effects Not Cleared
    * Exceeds Arrangement
    * Awaiting Banker’s Confirmation
  * If your account goes into an overdraft, an additional minimum overdraft interest fee of S$20 will be charged.
  * A handling Commission of 1/8% (min. S$10, max. S$100) per cheque plus postage of S$6.50 and agent charges (where applicable) will be charged for any unsuccessful clearing of other currencies (non-SGD) and non-local USD cheques.
