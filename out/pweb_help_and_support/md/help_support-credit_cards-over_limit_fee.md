## Over Limit Fee

An over limit fee of S$40 will be charged if your card's total outstanding balance exceeds its credit limit.

### An over limit fee will be charged in these situations:

  * Upon expiry of a temporary credit limit increase, when outstanding card balances are not paid and exceeds the card's original credit limit.
  * When annual fees / late fees / finance or interest charges / cash advance fees / returned GIRO or cheque fees are levied upon a credit card with insufficient credit limit.
