# Fixed Deposit Placement

Learn how you can make DBS Fixed Deposit Placements via digibank online and digibank mobile.

## Important information

  * DBS Fixed Deposit allows you to place both SGD and Foreign currency within the same account.
  * The minimum placement amount and period are: 
    * For SGD Fixed Deposit, the minimum amount is S$1,000, with a choice of tenors from 1 month onwards.
    * For Foreign Currency Fixed Deposit, the minimum amount is S$5,000 equivalent, with a choice of tenors from 1 day onwards.
    * For Premier Income Accounts, the minimum amount is S$10,000, with a choice of tenors from 6 months onwards.
  * Upon maturity, the Fixed Deposit placement (including interest) will be renewed automatically based on the same tenor at the prevailing interest rate, unless you provide us with other instructions **at least 1 working day before the maturity** via digibank.
  * SGD Fixed Deposit interest rates for new placements and renewals will be computed based on the **Total SGD Fixed Deposit Balances** , instead of each placement and/or renewal. 

Example

    * **My Fixed Deposit account has 2 placements which sum up to S$100,000 (S$30,000 + S$70,000). What is the applicable interest rate for each renewal?**  
The total Fixed Deposit account balance is S$100,000 (S$30,000 + S$70,000). Hence, interest rate corresponding to the $100,000 - $249,999 range will apply.  

    * **I have an existing placement of S$50,000 in my single name Fixed Deposit account and another S$50,000 in a joint Fixed Deposit account. What is the applicable interest rate for each renewal?**  
The placements are in different SGD Fixed Deposit accounts. Hence, interest rate corresponding to the $50,000 - $99,999 range will apply for each renewal.  


  * Foreign Currency Fixed Deposit interest rates for new placements and renewals will be based on prevailing [interest rates](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/rates-online/foreign-currency-fixed-deposits.page).
