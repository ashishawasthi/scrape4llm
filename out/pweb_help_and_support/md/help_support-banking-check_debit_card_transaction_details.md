### Frequently Asked Questions

#####  What are unbilled transactions?

Unbilled transactions are completed transactions which will be reflected in your next statement. 

#####  What are pending transactions?

Pending transactions are recent debit card payments sent to the merchant that are yet to be processed on their end. These are normally put on hold for 10 days (excluding Sundays and PH) from the date of transaction, until the merchant settles and collects the funds. However, if there is no merchant settlement within this period, the pending transaction will be dropped. 

#####  What are billed transactions (current statement)?

Billed transactions are completed transactions which have been reflected in your statement and due for payment. Learn more about how you can check your statements [here](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/support/bank-statements-viewing-estatements.html). 

#####  What are declined transactions?

Declined transactions are failed transactions where payment was unsuccessful and the merchant did not receive the payment.
