# Enhancing Card Usage Security 

Learn the functions of the EMV Smart chip and understand the improved securities put in place to protect your card against fraud.

__  
  


__ What is EMV?

EMV stands for Europay, MasterCard, Visa which is a joint effort to ensure security and global Interoperability so that MasterCard and Visa cards can continue to be accepted everywhere. With the EMV Smart Chip, your card is protected against fraudulent activities and you can enjoy the highest level of security when transacting on your Card.   
  


__ How does my EMV Chip Card offer enhanced security against fraud?

The microprocessor chip on the EMV Chip Card is protected by cryptographic encryption, which prevents its contents from being replicated. The chip-based card complies with the MAS standards of data security. Magnetic stripe cards, on the other hand, use an older technology making the card vulnerable to cloning.

__ Can I use my EMV Chip Card overseas?

Yes, you may use your EMV Chip Card overseas. However, in some countries, EMV Chip Cards are not prevalent and not all terminals accept EMV Chip Cards. In these countries, your transactions can still be processed via the magnetic stripe.   
  


__ Can I use the EMV Chip Card for online transactions as well as at ATMs?

Yes, you can use your EMV Chip Card for online purchases and perform cash advances at ATMs. You may also perform cash withdrawals at ATMs if you have linked your DBS Current/Savings account to your Credit/Debit Card.
