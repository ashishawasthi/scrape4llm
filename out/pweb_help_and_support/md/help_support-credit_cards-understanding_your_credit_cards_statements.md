### How is my Minimum Payment amount Calculated?

Minimum payment amount is calculated at 3% of your statement balance (or S$50, whichever is greater) plus any amount that is carried forward from the previous bill.

### * Points that you have earned from more recent transactions (ie. unposted transactions) may not be reflected yet.
