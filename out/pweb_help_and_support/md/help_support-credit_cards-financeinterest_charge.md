# Help & Support -> Credit Cards -> Finance/Interest Charge

## Finance/Interest Charge

Finance/Interest Charges are computed at the prevailing interest rate of 27.80% per annum, calculated daily from the date of transaction until receipt of full payment, subject to a minimum fee of S$2.50.

### Understanding Finance/Interest Charge

#####  Interest Rate

You will have 25 interest-free days to make payment before your next Credit Card Statement is generated.  
  
If you have not made the full payment by the payment due date, you will be billed for finance/interest charge on your next Credit Card Statement computed at the prevailing rate of **27.80% per annum** , calculated daily from the date of transaction until receipt of full payment, subject to a minimum fee of S$2.50.  
  


###### Note:

  * Make **Full payment by the payment due date** stated in your Credit Card Statement to avoid being billed finance/interest charges.



#####  Increased Interest Rate

If you have not made the minimum payment by the payment due date, an increased interest rate of **30.80% per annum** will be applied to your outstanding balance in your credit card account from the first working day of the following month after your next Credit Card Statement is generated.  
  
Interest rates will be reinstated to **27.80% per annum** once minimum payment is made by the payment due date of the next subsequent Credit Card Statement.  
  
**Example 1** \- Minimum payment made by the payment due date of the next subsequent Credit Card Statement.  
  
  
  
  
**Example 2** \- Minimum payment missed by the payment due date of the next subsequent Credit Card Statement.
