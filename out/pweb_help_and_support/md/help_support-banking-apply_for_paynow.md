### Frequently Asked Questions

#####  I already have PayNow registered with another Bank and would like to change my linked account to a DBS/POSB Account. What can I do? 

If you have already registered your NRIC/FIN or mobile number as a PayNow Proxy with another bank, you will first need to de-register your Proxy from the other bank. Please note that you cannot register the same NRIC/FIN or mobile number as a PayNow Proxy with 2 different banks. Once you’ve de-registered your Proxy from the other bank, simply follow the steps mentioned above to apply for PayNow with DBS/POSB. 

#####  I attempted to register for PayNow, but it shows that my mobile number is already registered with another bank. I have no recollection of performing this registration. What should I do?

Such a scenario might arise if you are using a recycled mobile number that used to belong to someone else. If you have never registered your mobile number as a PayNow Proxy with another bank, please [Get in Touch with Us](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/bank-with-ease/contact-us?pid=sg-dbs-help-support-bank-ssb-paynow-register-profile.html#slideToN1018D). 

#####  I recently became a Singapore Permanent Resident (PR) and would like to register my NRIC as a PayNow Proxy. What will happen to my FIN Proxy?

Once you receive your blue NRIC, please proceed to the nearest DBS/POSB branch to update your NRIC in the bank's records. During the update process, your FIN Proxy will be de-registered from PayNow and your NRIC will become eligible for registration.  
  
You can subsequently register your NRIC as a PayNow Proxy, via DBS digibank online, digibank mobile or digibank (Wealth). 

#####  I am a foreigner. How do I register my FIN as a PayNow proxy?

If you have already updated your FIN number with DBS/POSB, you can register your FIN as a PayNow Proxy via DBS digibank online, digibank mobile or digibank (Wealth).  
  
If you are unable to see an option to register your FIN for PayNow, it might be because you have not updated your FIN with DBS. Learn more about how to [update your Personal Details](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/support/general-profile-update-personal-details.html?pid=sg-dbs-help-support-bank-ssb-paynow-register-profile.html).
