# Rejected CPF/SRS Trades

Find out what will happen if a trade you placed through your CPF Investment Account(CPFIA)/SRS account is rejected.

  


## Rejection procedure

  * Your CPFIA/SRS agent bank will inform DBS Vickers of your rejected CPF/SRS Trades. If such cases arise, our staff will contact you, and your trade will be changed to an ordinary cash trade.



Type of Transaction

| Settlement Process  
---|---  
  
Buy Transaction

| Depending on your regular mode of payment, you will have to pay by cash, cheque, GIRO or EPS. Alternatively, funds will be debited via your Multi-Currency Account (MCA).  
  
Sell Transaction

| If you hold sufficient shares in your CDP securities account, the shares will be debited from your CDP securities account on the settlement date. However, if you have insufficient shares on the settlement date, a "buy-in" will be conducted by SGX to cover the "short-sell" position.  
  
## More information

  * In the event of insufficient funds or shares, your trade will be rejected by your CPFIA/SRS agent bank.
  * DBS Vickers **cannot** perform a contract amendment after trade date. There is strictly **no exception** for you to top up funds after trade date & ask for the CPF/SRS contract to be fulfilled subsequently.
