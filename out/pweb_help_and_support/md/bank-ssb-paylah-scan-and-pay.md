SGQR FAQs

  1. **What is a SGQR and how do I pay with PayLah! scanning a SGQR?**  
  
SGQR is the common QR standard used in Singapore. A merchant using various payment methods such as NETS QR, PayNow QR etc. are standardized into a single QR code. You can scan a SGQR with PayLah! when you notice NETS or PayNow QR in the SGQR sticker. 
  

  2. **Will I be prompted to select the payment QR/method to pay with PayLah! every time?**  
  
If you are scanning a SGQR for the first time, and if that SGQR has multiple payment QR (or payment methods) that PayLah! supports (e.g. NETS QR, PayNow QR etc.), you will be prompted to choose your preferred payment QR to pay.  
  
However, you will have an option to set your preferred payment QR by turning on the toggle button "Set as preferred QR". Once done, you will not be prompted for "Select QR to pay with PayLah!", and your preferred payment QR will automatically be selected for your future transactions as long as it is found in the merchant’s SGQR.  
  
Even if you have not saved any preference using the toggle button "Set as preferred QR", PayLah! will remember your last payment QR via SGQR and will automatically select that for your future transactions as long as the payment method is found in the SGQR.   
  
You may still change your payment QR any time by tapping on available option in the dropdown list. 
  

  3. **How do I select my preferred payment QR for my Scan & Pay transactions?**  
  
When you scan a SGQR that has multiple payment QRs, such as, NETS QR, PayNow QR etc., you will have an option to set your preferred payment QR by turning on the toggle button "Set as preferred QR". Once done, your preferred payment QR will automatically be selected for future transactions as long as it is found in the SGQR. You may still change your payment QR any time by tapping on available options in the dropdown list. 
  

  4. **How do I change the preferred payment QR for my transaction?**  
  
If you want to change your preferred payment QR, you can do so by selecting your payment QR, toggling on "Set as preferred QR" and proceeding to make your payment. The selected payment QR will automatically be saved as preferred payment method for future purchases 
  

  5. **How do I know which payment methods are available for me to select for my SGQR Scan & Pay transaction? **  
  
After you scan a SGQR, you will have a dropdown list that shows all the payment QRs available in the SGQR, that are supported by PayLah!. You may choose your preferred payment QR to pay from the dropdown list. 
  

  6. **Why is there no option to select another payment QR?**  
  
This happens when the SGQR has only one payment QR that PayLah! supports. And hence, being the only payment QR available, unfortunately you’ll be unable to select other payment QR. 
  

  7. **What is the benefit for me to change between the different payment QRs or methods (NETS QR / PayNow QR) for payment?**  
  
We are bringing this benefit to our PayLah! users, so that they can avail any promotions associated with a payment QR at any merchant. If you see a cashback or a promotion associated with a particular payment QR or method (such as NETS QR, or PayNow QR), you may choose to select your preferred payment QR to pay with PayLah! and enjoy the benefits. 
  

  8. **What are the types of DBS/POSB apps that support this new function?**  
  
You can scan a SGQR with your DBS PayLah!, DBS/POSB digibank and DBS iWealth apps. However, the facility to save your preferred way to pay is now made available only in DBS PayLah!.
