## Unsuccessful Fund Transfer to Another Bank Account

Ever experienced an unsuccessful Funds Transfer? Here are some possible reasons and ways you can resolve that. We hope that the information provided might help to resolve your problems.

#####  Wrong account number/Wrong recipient bank chosen

For FAST transfer to other banks: If your transaction history shows that the amount was debited from your account and then subsequently refunded, this might be due to you transferring funds to an invalid recipient or bank account. Therefore, you might want to check if you have keyed in the account number correctly or if you have chosen the correct bank name.   
  
Once you have verified your recipient’s bank account details, simply attempt your transfer again. 

#####  Recipient’s Account is inactive

For FAST transfer to other banks: If your transaction history shows that the amount was debited from your account and then subsequently refunded, this might be due to you transferring funds to an inactive account. Therefore, you might want to check with your recipient if his/her account is inactive.  
  
You may re-attempt the transfer, once you have verified that your recipient’s account is active and can be used to receive funds. 

#####  Closed Recipient Bank Account

Transactions might also fail due to the status of the recipient’s account. You may want to check with your recipient if his/her account is closed by their bank. 

#####  Non-fast transfer/Standing Instruction to Non-Financial Institutions
