## Differences in Total and Available Balance

Total balance is the total amount of money in your account, comprising of available   
balance (usable funds) & earmarked/holding balance (non-usable funds).

### Total Balance

  
Usable Funds | Non-Usable Funds  
---|---  
**Available Balance** |  **Earmarked Amounts** |  **Holding Balance**  
Available balance refers to the balance in your account available for spending, withdrawal or transfers. | Earmarked Amounts are funds set aside, possibly due to [Debit Card spending](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/support/card-transaction-view-transaction-details.html#headingFaqOne) and/or promotional Fixed Deposits that you may have signed up for. | Holding Balance indicates that a cheque deposit have been made into your account and is currently being processed for clearance.
