# Understanding DBS Multiplier's Bank & Earn Summary

Track your eligible transactions and interest earned easily with Bank & Earn Summary.

## Important information

  * Eligible transactions are automatically detected across the DBS/POSB products held by you. 
  * Preferential interest is credited by the 7th working day of the following month, if criteria is met.
  * If your transactions do not meet the criteria, the SGD balance in your DBS Multiplier Account will be accorded the prevailing interest rate for that month. [Learn More](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/rates-online/multiplier-account.page).
