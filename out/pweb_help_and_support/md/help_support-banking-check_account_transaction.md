### Frequently Asked Questions

#####  Why is the amount debited from my account higher than the transaction amount I made through the merchant website / mobile app?

If your card transaction is converted to Singapore dollars via dynamic currency conversion (a service offered at certain overseas merchants or websites), you will be subject to an administrative fee on the converted Singapore dollar amount, which shall be payable by you and debited from your Card account. This includes but is not limited to any card transaction in Singapore dollars on overseas-based websites and mobile applications. Learn more about [Overseas Card Transaction Fees](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/support/card-charges-and-fees-overseas-transaction-fees.html?pid=sg-dbs-help-support-bank-deposit-accounts-account-transactions.html). 

#####  I spotted an unauthorised transaction in my account. What should I do?

  * Log in to digibank mobile to check the transaction.
