### Important information

  * **Be careful of suspicious links**  
Malware (malicious software) is usually spread through text messages, emails or websites designed to lure victims into clicking on suspicious links.  
_TIP: If you wish to visit a webpage, it is safer to type the URL on the address bar of your browser than to click on it from an email or another site._
  

  * **It is better to be safe than sorry. Practice these security measures when installing apps (applications) / software on your device:**
    * Only install apps that are downloaded from official app stores. Unofficial app stores may carry malicious apps. Examples of official app stores are Apple App Store or Google Play Store.
    * Install the latest software updates on your device. This helps to ensure that bugs and vulnerabilities susceptible to attacks are addressed.
    * When installing applications, be mindful of the permissions granted (i.e. think if the permissions are really necessary).
  

  * **Use a strong password on your device**  
Secure your device with a strong password, pin or a relevant mechanism to prevent unauthorised use.  
_TIP: A strong password is one that is difficult to guess and contains a mix of letters, numbers or symbols. You can use this on top of your device touch ID (if you have any)._
  

  * **Do not "root" or "jailbreak" your device**  
Doing so makes your device more prone to security vulnerabilities. If you receive a prompt that your phone is not secure in PayLah! app, this could be because your device has been jailbroken/rooted or there have been past attempts in doing so. To protect your accounts from security vulnerabilities like viruses and malicious attacks, we would recommend that you use an unmodified mobile device with an updated operating system.
