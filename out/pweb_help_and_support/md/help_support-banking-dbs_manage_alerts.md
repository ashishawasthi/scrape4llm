### Important information

  * This service may be unavailable from 11.30pm to 3.00am daily, and on the last working day of the month from 8.30pm to 3.00am.
  * _Update on threshold limits for card transactions notification alerts_
    * Effective 20 July 2022, DBS has lowered the threshold limit for all DBS/POSB cards for notification alerts to **S$500**. Your threshold limit settings will not be changed if you have previously set a preferred alert threshold of S$500 and below.
    * This applies to all card transactions (including cash advance) made via AMEX, Mastercard, NETS, UnionPay or Visa. This is in line with industry wide anti-fraud measures to bolster card security. If you do not select a preferred alert threshold, the default setting is now S$500.
    * You may review and amend your existing threshold limit in receiving card transactions notification alerts via digibank online.
  * Your default threshold for **funds transfer** notification is set at S$100. [Learn more](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/support/general-scam-additional-measures.html#Threshold1).
