### Frequently Asked Questions

#####  How can I ensure that the person I am transferring funds to is the correct person?

Before performing a PayNow transfer, you should check whether the PayNow Proxy (mobile number/NRIC) you are sending funds to belongs to your intended payee. You may also check whether the displayed Nickname belongs to the person to whom you are transferring funds. 

#####  Will my name be revealed to the PayNow sender or receiver?

For PayNow transfers made by you, your recipient will be able to see your full name as registered with the bank. We are required to share this information with the receiving bank in line with the prevention of money laundering. The receiving bank may display your full name to enable the recipient to identify the sender.   
  
For PayNow transfers received by you, your sender will only be able to see your PayNow nickname as chosen by you.
