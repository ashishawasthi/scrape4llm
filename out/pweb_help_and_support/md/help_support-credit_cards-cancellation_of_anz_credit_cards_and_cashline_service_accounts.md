## Cancellation of ANZ Credit Cards and Cashline Service Accounts

Cancel your ANZ Credit Cards and Cashline Service Accounts easily through our digital banking services.

### Important information

  * In **August 2017** , ANZ Credit Cards and Moneyline accounts were successfully migrated to DBS.
  * If you have been issued a new DBS/POSB Card and/or Cashline, your outstanding ANZ balances were carried over to these new account(s).
  * If you already have a DBS/POSB Card and/or Cashline **prior** to the transfer, Service Accounts were created solely for paying off the outstanding balances.
  * If you have settled the outstanding balances fully and wish to cancel the Service Accounts, you can do it easily via our [Digital Service](https://chatbanking.dbs.com/mbsg/GCE/I300HS002).
